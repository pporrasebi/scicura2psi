Hi Astrid and Marcio,

After quite some time, I finally found the chance to have a look at the 
mappings from scicura. I am starting to put things together and I hope 
to have a mapping file and an xml version of your data soon, but I have 
a couple of questions first.

The most problematic part is representing the TG annotation fields, as 
we already anticipated. The main issue is that, in many cases, there is 
no idnetifier provided for the specific TG in the scicura files you sent 
me. There are 724 cases in the 'scicura_annotation.xlsx' file 
(spreadsheet 'plain_example') for which the TG name is just '(gene)'. If 
I interpret this correctly, this means that the specific gene to which 
the TF associated was not identified or could not be mapped. Is that so? 
Do you keep an internal file with the sequences or some other 
identifying feature for these cases? They will be problematic when 
generating the file,although I can force the creation of an internal 
identifier if needed.

Another thing I would like to discuss is the annotation of the TG 
element with the Sequence Ontology terms. I will incorporate all these 
terms as cross-references to the TG 'participant', if that's fine with 
you. Let me know otherwise, please.

I think that's it for now, I hope to have something ready before the 
meeting in Rome. Are you both going?

Cheers,

Pablo.
