Thanks a lot, Astrid. It will take me some time to digest everything and 
see if I have all I need, we just had a couple of big submissions and I 
am travelling next week. I'll try to come back to you as soon as I can, 
but bear with me, please!

Cheers,

Pablo.

          <div>&gt;&gt;</div>
          <div>&gt;&gt;Hi again,</div>
          <div>&gt;&gt;</div>
          <div>&gt;&gt;I have started working on the mappings and found
            some problems with the</div>
          <div>&gt;&gt;excel spreadsheet you sent me on Friday and also
            with some of the rules</div>
          <div>&gt;&gt;that were put together with Sandra before I
            started working on this. I</div>
          <div>&gt;&gt;need to have these issues solved before I can
            create a proper mapping</div>
          <div>&gt;&gt;from Scicura format to PSI-MI XML.</div>
          <div>&gt;&gt;</div>
          <div>&gt;&gt;Let's do your translation table first. I have
            been comparing your</div>
          <div>&gt;&gt;mappings for the TF representation with mine and
            there are still a few</div>
          <div>&gt;&gt;things that are not clear to me. I have attached
            a new comparison file</div>
          <div>&gt;&gt;for you to re-check. Here's a summary of the
            issues I found with the</div>
          <div>&gt;&gt;mappings:</div>
          <div>&gt;&gt;</div>
          <div>&gt;&gt;     1.- You propose no distinction between
            knock-down and knock-out of</div>
          <div>&gt;&gt;a given TF, but these can be distinguished using
            the PSI-MI cv.</div>
          <div>&gt;&gt;Although your mapping proposes using
            'underexpressed level', there are</div>
          <div>&gt;&gt;child terms in the cv for both 'knock-down' and
            'knock-out'. I would</div>
          <div>&gt;&gt;propose using the more specific terms rather than
            the parent.</div>
          <div>&gt;</div>
          <div>&gt;[Astrid Lægreid]<b><i>(20.09.17)</i></b></div>
          <div>&gt;</div>
          <div>&gt;Yes, thank you for suggesting the more specific terms</div>
          <div>&gt;</div>
          <div>&gt;Since you ask whether KO should be created:</div>
          <div>&gt;in cases where genetic "knock out is complete for
            both alleles (may in fact be</div>
          <div>&gt;the case in most instances) I think it could be nice
            to have the term "knock</div>
          <div>&gt;out", but it is also ok to use "knock down" for in
            all instances</div>
          <div>&gt;</div>

          <div><font color="#0070C0"><b><i>I have commented in the excel
                  that it is good to use both terms in the appropriate
                  places (as you have also suggested): knock down and
                  knock out</i></b></font></div>
          <div><font color="#0070C0"> </font></div>
          <div><font color="#0070C0"><b><i>I could not find child terms
                  of </i></b><b><i>knock down and knock out</i></b></font></div>

          <div> </div>
          <div>&gt;</div>
          <div>&gt;&gt;</div>
          <div>&gt;&gt;     2.- In many cases the Scicura term refers to
            purified protein and</div>
          <div>&gt;&gt;you have proposed using 'partially purified'
            instead of 'purified' in</div>
          <div>&gt;&gt;some -but not all- cases. For example,
            termID:280919 (recombinant</div>
          <div>&gt;&gt;mutated TF with HA tag purified from E.coli cell
            extract) has been mapped as</div>
          <div>&gt;'partially purified'.</div>
          <div>&gt;&gt;However, termID:280920 (recombinant mutated TF
            with Biotin tag purified</div>
          <div>&gt;&gt;from E.coli cell extract) has not been mapped to
            anything at all. I</div>
          <div>&gt;&gt;imagine this is just an oversight, is there any
            reason why some cases</div>
          <div>&gt;&gt;have been mapped and others not? Also, what's the
            reason for using</div>
          <div>&gt;&gt;'partially purified' instead of 'purified'?</div>

          <div>&gt;</div>
          <div>&gt;It seemed a bit less risky with 'partially', I was

          <div>&gt;&gt;expression) has been mapped to 'subcellular
            preparation', but I cannot</div>
          <div>&gt;&gt;see anything in the name or description of the
            term that points out why</div>
          <div>&gt;&gt;a subcellular fraction is used here. Could you

          <div>&gt;My mistake, sorry! Thank you for pointing it out</div>

          <div>&gt;&gt;     4.- There are several cases in which I
            suggest to use the term 'endogenous'</div>
          <div>&gt;&gt;additionally to signify that the endogenous
            protein was used in the assay.</div>

          <div>&gt;&gt;     5.- Finally, in some other cases, the term
            hints that a cell</div>
          <div>&gt;&gt;lysate has been used. I have added this term as
            well, although I saw no</div>
