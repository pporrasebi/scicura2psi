Hi Pablo,

I now went through all lines in the comparison TF_representation file you s=
ent, and added comments to the best of my ability in red in new columns E, =
G and I (file enclosed)

Please also see comments in line in the e-mail below =96 marked blue to dis=
tinguish from the remarks I already put in on September 20

In the "rules" excel, I looked at the additions you made in
- first sheet "Int. methods vs part. methods", this looks ok to me
- sheet "int. methods vs host organism" - where you point to SciCura to Int=
Act hos translations in next sheet for ChIP, this also looks ok

I will do my best to respond quickly to additional info and comments and in=
put that you would like from me

Best wishes
Astrid

[Astrid L=E6greid]

I have commented in the excel that it is good to use both terms in the appr=
opriate places (as you have also suggested): knock down and knock out

I could not find child terms of knock down and knock out
Sorry, not sure what you mean by =93using the more specific terms rather th=
an the parent=94

>
>>
>>     2.- In many cases the Scicura term refers to purified protein and

[Astrid L=E6greid]

So, I=92ve stated =93ok=94 for all instances of =93purified=94 that you hav=

>

[Astrid L=E6greid]

Ok, as suggested by you


>>     4.- There are several cases in which I suggest to use the term 'endo=
genous'

.
>

[Astrid L=E6greid]

Yes, fine as suggested by you

>>     5.- Finally, in some other cases, the term hints that a cell

I think I=92ve checked all instances and seen that they are ok as suggested=

Not quite sure how the reporter gene assay issue is best solved in intAct/p=

<div>&gt;&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.- In many cases the Scicura term refers =
to purified protein and</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;you have proposed using 'partially purified' instead of 'purif=
ied' in</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;some -but not all- cases. For example, termID:280919 (recombin=
ant</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;mutated TF with HA tag purified from E.coli cell extract) has =
been mapped as</div>
<div>&gt;'partially purified'.</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;However, termID:280920 (recombinant mutated TF with Biotin tag=
 purified</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;from E.coli cell extract) has not been mapped to anything at a=
ll. I</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;imagine this is just an oversight, is there any reason why som=
e cases</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;have been mapped and others not? Also, what's the reason for u=
sing</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;'partially purified' instead of 'purified'?</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;[Astrid L=E6greid] ]<b><i>(20.09.17)</i></b></div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;It seemed a bit less risky with 'partially', I was not sure which =
degree of</div>
<div>&gt;purification you require for &quot;purified&quot;</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;If you say &quot;purified&quot; is ok, it's fine with me</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;</div>
<div><font color=3D"#0070C0"><b><i>[Astrid L=E6greid] </i></b></font></div>

nces of =93purified=94 that you have suggested</i></b></font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.- termID:206990 (knock down by siRNA int=
erference with TF</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;expression) has been mapped to 'subcellular preparation', but =
I cannot</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;see anything in the name or description of the term that point=
s out why</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;a subcellular fraction is used here. Could you please explain =
why did</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;you map it to 'subcellular preparation'?</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;[Astrid L=E6greid] ]<b><i>(20.09.17)</i></b></div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;My mistake, sorry! Thank you for pointing it out</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;</div>
<div><font color=3D"#0070C0"><b><i>[Astrid L=E6greid] </i></b></font></div>

div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.- There are several cases in which I sug=
gest to use the term 'endogenous'</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;additionally to signify that the endogenous protein was used i=
n the assay.</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;[Astrid L=E6greid] ]<b><i>(20.09.17)</i></b></div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;Yes, thank you, I agree the term should be there</div>

font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.- Finally, in some other cases, the term=
 hints that a cell</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;lysate has been used. I have added this term as well, although=
 I saw no</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;references to it from your side.</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;[Astrid L=E6greid] ]<b><i>(20.09.17)</i></b></div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;Yes, thank you, I agree the term should be there</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;I have also been checking the 'rules' file you have been putti=
ng</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;together with Sandra (also attached). Most importantly, there =
is one sheet,</div>
<div>&gt;called 'Int.</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;methods vs part. methods' where there are a few suggested mapp=
ings that</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;have not been validated on your side. Would you please have a =
look and</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;let us know if the proposed terms are fine?</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;[Astrid L=E6greid] ]<b><i>(20.09.17)</i></b></div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;Yes, I think these mappings should be fine, thank you!</div>

<div><font color=3D"#0070C0"><b>Yes, look fine</b></font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;Also, I found two experimental methods in the plain_example ta=
ble that</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;are not mapped in 'rules': reporter gene assay (SC-ID:206987) =
and</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;southwestern blot (SC-ID:206917). For the first one, I propose=
 using</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;this MI term, please check and tell me if that's fine:</div>

<div>&gt;&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;[Astrid L=E6greid] ]<b><i>(20.09.17)</i></b></div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;To me, the suggested term, &quot;phenotype-based detection assay&q=
uot;, does not</div>
<div>&gt;seem optimal, because in the experiments we curate in many cases a=
ssass the</div>
<div>&gt;DbTF regulation of specific promoters (those of the specific targe=
t genes); I've</div>
<div>&gt;understood from Sandra that there is currently no term for reporte=
r gene</div>
<div>&gt;</div>

ay issue is best solved in intAct/psi-mi =96 maybe we should try to do a sk=
ype on that?</i></b></font></div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;For southwestern blot there is just no term in the MI vocabula=
ry, but I</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;can create one, if that's OK.</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;[Astrid L=E6greid] ]<b><i>(20.09.17)</i></b></div>

<div>&gt;&gt;I think that's it. Once we have all these issues solved, I hop=

<div>&gt;&gt;create a comprehensive set of mapping tables and generate the =
mappings.</div>
