Hi Pablo,=0A=
=0A=
Thanks a lot for this!=0A=
I hope to find time to work on this tomorrow - sorry that I'm not able to f=
ind time earlier, but my schedule got a bit overcrowded these days=0A=
=0A=
Best wishes=0A=

Emne: Re: TF experimental preparation=0A=
=0A=
Hi again,=0A=
=0A=
I have started working on the mappings and found some problems with the=0A=
excel spreadsheet you sent me on Friday and also with some of the rules=0A=
that were put together with Sandra before I started working on this. I=0A=
need to have these issues solved before I can create a proper mapping=0A=
from Scicura format to PSI-MI XML.=0A=
=0A=
Let's do your translation table first. I have been comparing your=0A=
mappings for the TF representation with mine and there are still a few=0A=
things that are not clear to me. I have attached a new comparison file=0A=
for you to re-check. Here's a summary of the issues I found with the=0A=
mappings:=0A=
=0A=
     1.- You propose no distinction between knock-down and knock-out of=0A=
a given TF, but these can be distinguished using the PSI-MI cv. Although=0A=
your mapping proposes using 'underexpressed level', there are child=0A=
terms in the cv for both 'knock-down' and 'knock-out'. I would propose=0A=
using the more specific terms rather than the parent.=0A=
=0A=
     2.- In many cases the Scicura term refers to purified protein and=0A=
you have proposed using 'partially purified' instead of 'purified' in=0A=
some -but not all- cases. For example, termID:280919 (recombinant=0A=
mutated TF with HA tag purified from E.coli cell extract) has been=0A=
mapped as 'partially purified'. However, termID:280920 (recombinant=0A=
mutated TF with Biotin tag purified from E.coli cell extract) has not=0A=
been mapped to anything at all. I imagine this is just an oversight, is=0A=
there any reason why some cases have been mapped and others not? Also,=0A=
what's the reason for using 'partially purified' instead of 'purified'?=0A=
=0A=
     3.- termID:206990 (knock down by siRNA interference with TF=0A=
expression) has been mapped to 'subcellular preparation', but I cannot=0A=
see anything in the name or description of the term that points out why=0A=
a subcellular fraction is used here. Could you please explain why did=0A=
you map it to 'subcellular preparation'?=0A=
=0A=
     4.- There are several cases in which I suggest to use the term=0A=
'endogenous' additionally to signify that the endogenous protein was=0A=
used in the assay.=0A=
=0A=
     5.- Finally, in some other cases, the term hints that a cell lysate=0A=
has been used. I have added this term as well, although I saw no=0A=
references to it from your side.=0A=
=0A=
I have also been checking the 'rules' file you have been putting=0A=
together with Sandra (also attached). Most importantly, there is one=0A=
sheet, called 'Int. methods vs part. methods' where there are a few=0A=
suggested mappings that have not been validated on your side. Would you=0A=
please have a look and let us know if the proposed terms are fine?=0A=
=0A=
Also, I found two experimental methods in the plain_example table that=0A=
are not mapped in 'rules': reporter gene assay (SC-ID:206987) and=0A=
southwestern blot (SC-ID:206917). For the first one, I propose using=0A=
this MI term, please check and tell me if that's fine:=0A=
=0A=
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mi/terms?iri=3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolib=
rary.org%2Fobo%2FMI_1088=0A=
=0A=
For southwestern blot there is just no term in the MI vocabulary, but I=0A=
can create one, if that's OK.=0A=
=0A=
I think that's it. Once we have all these issues solved, I hope I can=0A=
create a comprehensive set of mapping tables and generate the mappings.=0A=
=0A=
Cheers,=0A=
